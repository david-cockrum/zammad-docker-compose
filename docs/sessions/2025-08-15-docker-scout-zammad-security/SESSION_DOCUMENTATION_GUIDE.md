## 🔧 3. Automation Tools

### Command History Capture
```bash
# Save session commands with timestamps
script -q ~/sessions/session-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log

# Or use terminal recording
asciinema rec session.cast

# Extract commands from history
history | tail -100 > commands-$(date +%Y%m%d).sh
```

### Git-Based Documentation
```bash
# Create session branch
git checkout -b session/2025-08-15-docker-setup

# Commit with detailed messages
git commit -m "feat: Docker Scout integration

Session Objectives:
- Set up Docker Scout for vulnerability scanning
- Configure CI/CD pipeline
- Create security documentation

Key Decisions:
- Used official Zammad images as base
- Implemented runtime patching strategy
- Created automated setup scripts

Results:
- 3 HIGH vulnerabilities addressed
- CI/CD pipeline configured
- Complete documentation created

References:
- Session date: 2025-08-15
- Duration: 2 hours
- Tools: Docker Scout, GitHub Actions"
```

## 💾 4. Storage Best Practices

### Version Control
```yaml
What to Commit:
  - Scripts and automation tools
  - Configuration files
  - Documentation (Markdown)
  - Dockerfiles and compose files
  
What NOT to Commit:
  - Credentials or secrets
  - Large binary files
  - Temporary outputs
  - Personal notes with sensitive info
```

### Documentation Formats
```yaml
Markdown (.md):
  - Primary documentation
  - READMEs and guides
  - Session summaries

Shell Scripts (.sh):
  - Reproducible commands
  - Automation tools

YAML/JSON:
  - Configuration files
  - Structured data

Diagrams:
  - Use Mermaid in Markdown
  - Or PlantUML for complex diagrams
```

## 🤝 5. Collaboration & Sharing

### Team Knowledge Sharing
```markdown
## Weekly Session Recap
**Date**: 2025-08-15
**Topic**: Docker Security Implementation
**Duration**: 2 hours

### What We Did
- Implemented Docker Scout scanning
- Created CI/CD pipeline
- Built security-patched images

### Key Learnings
1. Docker Scout requires organization enrollment
2. GitHub Actions needs Docker Hub secrets
3. Runtime patching is temporary

### Reusable Assets
- `setup-github-secrets.sh` - Automates secret configuration
- `Dockerfile.secure` - Security-hardened image
- `DOCKER_SCOUT_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation

### Recording
- [Video walkthrough](link)
- [Command history](link)
- [GitHub PR](link)
```

## 🚀 6. Creating Runbooks

### Runbook Template
```markdown
# Runbook: [Process Name]

## Purpose
Brief description of what this runbook accomplishes

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Access to X system
- [ ] Y credentials configured
- [ ] Z tools installed

## Procedure
### Step 1: [Action]
```bash
exact command to run
```
**Expected Output**: Description or example

### Step 2: [Action]
[Instructions]

## Validation
- [ ] Check X is running: `command`
- [ ] Verify Y is configured: `command`

## Rollback
If something goes wrong:
1. Step to undo
2. Command to revert

## Troubleshooting
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
